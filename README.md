# Previously: 
- This was a repos containing my neovim config and my wallpapers that I used on cachyos while dual booting with windows.
  
# Currently:
- I have moved to cachyos full time and this repo is to track important files and configurations that I use on cachyos.
- Things like setups,videos and applications would not be uploaded because the files are bigger and  can be
redownloaded or moved to an external drive.
